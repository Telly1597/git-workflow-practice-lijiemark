## What is interesting about MetaVerse? ##

I've always been interested in the idea of Metaverse, and this article gives a very interesting presentation of which stage the concept of Metaverse is in its development. 

1. Like early stage of internet: 
People have been talking about Metaverse as the next future of the internet (or it's a video game, as the article put it, or a VR version of zoom.) It is interesting to see how it compares "the metaverse" to "the internet" in the 1970s, as it's a developing idea and technology that's at its infancy but has the potential in shifting the ways people connect with each other. 

2. Like early stage of computer / cinema:
The technology associated with metaverse is virtual reality. Just like Metaverse, the development of virtual reality is still at an earlier age. As an entertainment medium, it resembles the early development of films; and the headsets of VR equipment are like the early stages of computers -  Although with all its wonders, VR headsets are still quite chunky and uncomfortable. 

Therefore, it's interesting to think about Metaverse as the future but most of its elements still need time to develop, and hopefully, it won't take too long. 

***Can you imagine Metaverse as the future?***

1.  the future looks bright with Metaverse. However,  we first must have some honest conversation about how  Metaverse would impact our social life, and How to overcome those challenges.
